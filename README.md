# CourseSelector
Course Selector Telegram Bot 

CourseSelector is a Telegram Bot that has two functionalities directed to Bilkent University students.

1) It lets them find out courses that fit into their schedules.
2) It lets them set up quota hooks that notify them once a quota opens in their course(s) of interest.

University recently implemented a CAPTCHA system to the webpage that the bot constantly connects to. 
Actually, it was the case for course offering pages for a long time 
but I thought I had found a page that doesn't require any "I'm not a bot" checks. I was wrong.

Now there are two possibilities. I'll either implement a captcha solver subsystem (hard) or try to find a webpage 
that doesn't require any checks(possibly easier).
